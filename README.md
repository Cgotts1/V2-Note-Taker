This project was made using express and node.js, which allows users to create and save notes. Once a user has given their note a title and has also finished writing the note text, a save button will appear. Clicking on it will store their note to the left side of the application for future reference and can click on their past note to see the content of it towards the rightside of the application. To add a note, users can click on the + sign in the top right corner. Clicking on the red trashcan allows for the deletion of specific notes.
